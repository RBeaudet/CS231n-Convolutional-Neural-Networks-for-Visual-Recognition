# Assignment 2

The objective of this assignment is to practice writing backpropagation code, and training Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

* understand Neural Networks and how they are arranged in layered architectures
* understand and be able to implement (vectorized) backpropagation
* implement various update rules used to optimize Neural Networks
* implement Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization for training deep networks
* implement Dropout to regularize networks
* understand the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks and get practice with training these models on data
* gain experience with a major deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
