# Assignment 1

The goal of this assignment is to implement a simple image classification pipeline, based on the k-Nearest Neighbor or the SVM/Softmax classifier :

* understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)
* understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning.
* develop proficiency in writing efficient vectorized code with numpy
* implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier
* implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
* implement and apply a Softmax classifier
* implement and apply a Two layer neural network classifier
* understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers
* get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using higher-level representations than raw pixels (e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Gradient (HOG) features)
